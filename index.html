<h3>Bio</h3>
I am a third year Computer Science PhD student at Boston Univeristy where I work with <a href="https://cs-people.bu.edu/sofya/">Prof. Sofya Raskhodnikova</a> 
and <a href="https://cs-people.bu.edu/ads22/">Prof. Adam Smith</a>.
I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science & Engineering from <a href="https://iitgn.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar</a>.
Previously I worked as a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/careers/divisions/engineering/">Goldman Sachs</a>, Hyderabad.

working with <a href="https://www.tcs.tifr.res.in/people/rahul-vaze">Prof. Rahul Vaze</a>.

<h3>Research Interests</h3>
I am broadly interested in a mix of Computer Science Theory wihich has a flavor of algorithms, probability and statistics. 
Currently I am interested in Differential Privacy and Sublinear Algorithms.

<h3>News</h3>
Our paper on <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10512">Differentially Private Multi-Sampling from Distributions</a> with Albert Cheu got accepted at <a href="http://algorithmiclearningtheory.org/alt2025/">ALT 2025</a>.
