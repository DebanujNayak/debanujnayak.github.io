<br>
During my undergraduate, I was fortunate to work with the <a href="https://iitgn.ac.in/faculty/cse/anirban">Prof. Anirban Dasgupta</a>, 
<a href="https://iitgn.ac.in/faculty/cse/neeldhara">Prof. Neeldhara Misra</a> and <a href="https://iitgn.ac.in/faculty/cse/manoj">Prof. Manoj Gupta</a> from IIT Gandhinagar.
I also spent a summer at <a href="https://www.tcs.tifr.res.in/">Tata Institute of Fundamental Research</a> 
working with <a href="https://www.tcs.tifr.res.in/people/rahul-vaze">Prof. Rahul Vaze</a>.

<h3>Research Interests</h3>
I am broadly interested in a mix of Computer Science Theory wihich has a flavor of algorithms, probability and statistics. 
Specific areas I want to explore are 
<ul>
  <li> Differential Privacy </li>
  <li> Learning Theory</li>
  <li> Robust Algorithmic Statistics in High dimensions </li>
  <li> Randomized Linear Algebra </li>
  <li> Sketching/ Streaming algorithms </li>
  <li> Theory of Deep learning </li>
